This vignette documents the content provided in a package named linreg.
In thispackage Youâ€™ll learn how to work with multiple linear regression
by creating a new object of class *linreg* and using methods such as 
*print()*, *plot()* or *summary()*.


# Creating an object of class linreg
# Class linreg

The key content in our package is the class linreg. 
linreg() have two argument formula and data. the formula argument should take a formula object which can be created using the function model.matrix(). This function creates the matrix X (independent variables) and pick out the dependent variable using function all.vars(). 


## Other useful methods of class linreg

In addition to the basic statistic methods that **linreg** provides, there are available other three different methods: *print()*, *plot()* and *summary()*. These methods override the conventional functions with identical name when an object of class *linreg* is passed as an argument.


# print() function

print() function prints out the coefficients and coefficient names, similar as done by the *lm* class.


# plot() function

plot() function plots graphs using *ggplot2*.


# summary() function

summary() function returns a similar printout as printed for *lm* objects, but only with the coefficients with their standard error, t-value and p-value as well as the estimate of *sigma* and the degrees of freedom in the model.
